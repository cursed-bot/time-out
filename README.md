# time-out
A very simple program that keeps track of how long students are out of the classroom, written in Rust.
This is based off of an idea I got from a teacher at the Middle School that I work at.

To build from source, simply clone this repo and use "Cargo run" 

No dependencies are requried aside from Rust to build the binary, but this will most likely change in the future.

TODO
* Add a GUI frontend
* Add logging fuctionality
* Make code a little bit cleaner
